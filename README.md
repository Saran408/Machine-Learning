# Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

Detailed pdf plus handwritten notes of Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng in collaboration between DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. In this you can view the first course notes of the specialization, Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification.

# Intro to **Machine Learning**

Machine Learning is the Ability of computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. There are different types of Machine Learning Algorithms.

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Recommender Systems
4. Reinforcement Learning

# Supervised Learning

Machines are trained using well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output. It find a mapping function to map the input variable(x) with the output variable(y). Some use cases are given below,

- Spam Filtering
- Speech Recognition / Text Translation
- Online Advertising
- Self-Driving Car
- Visual Inspection (Identifying defect in products)

### Types of Supervised Learning

1. **Regression** (Predict a number)
2. **Classification** (Predict categories)

# Unsupervised Learning

Models are not supervised using labelled training dataset. Instead, models itself find the hidden patterns and insights from the given data. It learns from un-labelled data to predict the output. 

### Types of Unsupervised Learning

1. **Clustering** (Group similar data)
2. **Anomaly Detection** (Finds unusual data points)
3. **Dimensionality Reduction** (Compress data to fewer numbers)

# **REGRESSION**

Regression is a technique for  investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome. It’s used as a method for predictive modelling in machine learning in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes. Commonly used regression is 

### **Linear Regression**

1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Multiple linear regression

# **CLASSIFICATION**

In Classification, a program learns from the given dataset or observations and then classifies new observation into a number of classes or groups. Such as, Yes or No, 0 or 1, Spam or Not Spam, cat or dog etc. Classes can be called as targets/labels or categories. Commonly used classification is 

### **Logistic Regression**

In this note we will be heavily focusing on the math behind the Linear and Logistic Regression Models.

# **LINEAR REGRESSION**

- It is fitting a straight line to your data.
- Model the relation between dependent (Input X) and independent (Output Y) by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
